    <h1>SURVIVAL HORROR, year unknown</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            The world isn't as it once was. It turns out life isn't all rainbows and sunshines. All life on the surface of the earth has died out. Humans had to take the measures needed to survive and are now POST-HUMAN, a state beyond what we know as "human", made possible through genetic manipulation and other biointerventionist measures and lived underground for decades. The few people who survived now has to rebuild the once lush and beautiful planet that once was.
