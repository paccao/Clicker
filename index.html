            <h1>SURVIVAL HORROR, year unknown</h1>
            <p>
                The world isn't as it once was. It turns out life isn't all
                rainbows and sunshines. All life on the surface of the earth has
                died out. Humans had to take the measures needed to survive and
                are now POST-HUMAN, a state beyond what we know as "human", made
                possible through genetic manipulation and other
                biointerventionist measures and lived underground for decades.
                The few people who survived now has to rebuild the once lush and
                beautiful planet that once was.
