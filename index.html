        <h1>SURVIVAL HORROR, year unknown</h1>
        <p>
            The world isn't as it once was. It turns out life isn't all rainbows and sunshines. All life on the surface
            of the earth has died out. Humans had to take the measures needed to survive and are now POST-HUMAN, a state
            beyond what we know as "human", made possible through genetic manipulation and other biointerventionist
            measures and lived underground for decades. The few people who survived now has to rebuild the once lush and
            beautiful planet that once was.
